*  **My goal is** to master a new profession, namely the profession of a programmer. I am attracted by the front-end javascript direction. I like to create something with my own hands (layout the site) and see the end result.
**My priorities:** learn html / css, javascript and further develop in this direction. My strong side is perseverance, the desire to change and improve, to go towards the set goal.
*  At the moment I am independently studying html and css, the basics of javascript.
-------
* Code examples

function isPalindrome(line) {
 let str = line.toString()
  palindromeWord = ''
  for(var i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    palindromeWord += str.charAt(i)
  }
  return palindromeWord === str
}
